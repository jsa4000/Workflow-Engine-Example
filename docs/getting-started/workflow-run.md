### Webapps

In order to run the **Process DMN**, you can go [Tasklist](http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist/default/) and **Start Process**. Then select the process to execute.

Then set the *Business Key* for the process instance to be created.

!!! note

    Business Key will be useful later to gather information about this instance and using other functionality such as **sending messages**. Instead of storing the internal identifier generated by Camunda (`UUID`) you can set a **external identifier**.

Refresh the page `F12` in order to get **all pending tasks**. Select the **Purchase Policy** task  and press **claim** to assign the task to yourself. Fill all the values and finally press **complete**.

Go to [Cockpit](http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/cockpit/default/) and select the **Process DMN** deployment and the current process instance to get process **information** and **insights**. From this **dashboard** you can get the **current state** of the process: watch all variables, current task and additional information.

Go to **Decisions**, then select the **Decision Table** used by this process (`Risk`) and select the **current process instance** being running. In this **dashboard** you can see the **decision made** by the **DMN** highlighted.

In **Camunda console** you must see following logs by using the **default values** in the forms. Different values will follow different paths in the flow that means different tasks and operations are performed.

```txt
Compute Policy MID risk
[result:true, risk:MID]
An email has been sent to the user to deny the policy.
```
